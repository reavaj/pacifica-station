Contract specialty data broker service. The purpose of this repository is to provide tools and APIs for matching high quality organic multi-modal data sets with AI/ML applications to verify performance under known, challenging conditions. Administered on the Ethereum blockchain using USDC for payments, this project matches a highly distributed group of data creators with developers to enable just-in-time specialty data testing. Think of it as analagous to a digital tool and die company, curating small batches of data for tuning AI/ML enabled applications.
