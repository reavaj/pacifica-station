# pacifica-station

Contract specialty data broker service. The purpose of this repository is to provide tools and APIs for matching high quality curated multi-modal data sets with AI/ML applications to verify performance under known, challenging conditions. Administered on the Ethereum blockchain using USDC for payments, this project matches curated data creators with testers to enable just-in-time specialty data testing. Think of it as analagous to contract chemical manufacturing, only with small batches of data for AI/ML enabled applications.
